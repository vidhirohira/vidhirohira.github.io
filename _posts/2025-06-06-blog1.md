 This week marked the start of the GSoC coding phase. I began work on my project SustainHub, which focuses on improving the stability of open-source communities using an agent-based model.

I started by setting up the task simulation environment in Python. The environment simulates a GitHub-like space where agents interact with tasks such as bug fixes, feature development, and documentation updates. I also defined the structure of the environment, including task queues, difficulty levels, and deadlines.

Next, I implemented four types of agents:
Maintainers
Contributors
Innovators
Knowledge Curators

Each agent has attributes like expertise level, task load, and success rate. I used Python classes to model their behavior and initialized them with basic logic for selecting tasks based on availability and skill.

I also created basic rule-based logic for assigning tasks to agents. This will serve as the foundation for more advanced techniques like Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms in the upcoming weeks.

Overall, Week 1 was focused on setting the foundation for the simulation framework. I will continue building on this by implementing dynamic task allocation strategies in Week 2.

Thanks for reading.
