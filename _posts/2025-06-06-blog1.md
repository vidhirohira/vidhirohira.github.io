Hello world! 🚀  
Welcome to my first blog post documenting my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 journey with the **Orthogonal Research and Education Lab**.

## 🗓️ Week 1: Environment and Agent Setup

This week marked the official beginning of the coding phase, and I focused on building a strong foundation for the **SustainHub** simulation.

### ✅ What I accomplished:

#### 🛠️ 1. Environment Initialization
- Built a **GitHub-like simulation environment** in Python.
- Designed task types:  
  - Bug fixes 🐞  
  - Feature requests ✨  
  - Documentation updates 📄
- Set up dynamic **task queues**, **difficulty levels**, and **task deadlines**.

#### 👩‍💻 2. Agent Definition and Role Assignment
- Implemented four key agent roles as Python classes:
  - **Maintainers**: Oversee project quality and merge PRs.
  - **Contributors**: Tackle bugs and implement features.
  - **Innovators**: Propose new ideas.
  - **Knowledge Curators**: Maintain documentation and knowledge artifacts.
- Initialized agent attributes:
  - Expertise Level (Apprentice → Expert)
  - Task Load
  - Success Rate

#### ⚙️ 3. Basic Task Assignment Logic
- Implemented **rule-based assignment** based on agent availability and expertise.
- Defined parameters to simulate realistic collaboration.

---

### 📚 Learnings:
- Python’s OOP principles came in handy for modularizing agent behavior.
- Carefully modeling environment variables helped clarify how complexity and deadlines affect task flow.
- Initial testing gave early insights into potential bottlenecks in future task allocation stages.

---

### 🔜 Next Up:
In Week 2, I’ll be working on:
- Implementing **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)** strategies for dynamic task assignment.
- Refining the task generation system to improve diversity and alignment with agent expertise.

Stay tuned as SustainHub evolves into a robust, intelligent agent-based framework for open-source project stability! 🌍✨
