# Week 8: Making SustainHub Interactive — GUI Integration Begins

After several weeks of backend development and metric evaluation, Week 8 marked the beginning of GUI integration for SustainHub. The goal was to provide an intuitive and flexible interface that allows users to run simulations without digging into the code.

---

## Key Highlights

- Developed the initial Tkinter-based GUI  
- Enabled user-configurable agent and step inputs  
- Integrated graphical output generation directly into the GUI  
- Retained terminal-based logs and debug outputs

---

## 1. Why a GUI?

While the command-line interface worked for internal testing, it’s time to make SustainHub more accessible to new users and community testers.

The GUI provides:
- Input fields for number of agents and simulation steps  
- A "Run Simulation" button that launches the backend  
- Automatic generation of plots and recovery curves  
- Complete access to under-the-hood logs via terminal output

---

## 2. Flexibility in User Inputs

Users can now experiment easily by changing:
- Number of agents participating in the simulation  
- Number of simulation steps to observe short- or long-term trends

This modular approach helps us debug and validate behavior across a wide parameter space without modifying code.

---

## 3. Visual Output + Terminal Logs

The GUI generates:
- Harmony Index recovery graphs  
- Stress vs. RQ trends, where applicable

All backend logs (SARSA decisions, Q-table updates, RQ values) are still visible in the terminal output, ensuring full transparency and debuggability.

All plots are stored in `data/plots/`, and logs remain available in the terminal and saved to `data/logs/`.

## 4. What’s Next?

- Polish GUI layout and aesthetics  
- Add toggle options for stress testing scenarios  
- Include real-time metric previews (RQ, HI, fairness)  
- Enable graph preview within the GUI itself

---

## Summary

This week, we shifted gears from metric definition to user accessibility and interaction. The new GUI empowers users to run stress-tested simulations with ease and ensures our system remains transparent, flexible, and research-friendly.

Next week, we’ll enhance the GUI with real-time metric previews and begin refactoring the backend to support richer interactions.

Stay tuned for more.
