# Week 9: Enhancing the SustainHub GUI — Usability and Aesthetics

Following the successful integration of a basic GUI in Week 8, Week 9 focused on refining the interface to improve user experience, readability, and interactivity. The goal was to make the interface not just functional, but intuitive and visually organized.

---

## Key Improvements

- **Tabbed Interface for Multi-Metric Graphs**  
  Users can now switch between different types of visualizations (e.g., Harmony Index, RQ Trends, Load Fairness) using a clean tabbed layout.

- **Improved Layout and Element Grouping**  
  Input fields, buttons, and plot previews are now better aligned and sectioned for clarity.

- **Inline Graph Previews (Beta)**  
  Preliminary support for displaying output plots directly within the GUI using embedded image panels.

## 1. Tabbed Graph Viewer

We introduced a tab-based navigation system using `ttk.Notebook`, allowing users to seamlessly explore different plots generated after each simulation. This removes clutter and enhances focus on specific metrics.

Each tab currently supports:
- Harmony Index recovery curves  
- Stress vs. Resilience Quotient (RQ) trends  
- Fairness and Load distribution metrics (if enabled)

## 2. Clean Separation of Controls and Outputs

The GUI now logically separates:
- **Input Section**: Agent count, step count, and Run Simulation button  
- **Output Section**: Real-time status display and graph previews  
- **Logs**: Terminal-based logs retained for transparency

This refactor ensures the interface scales well as more metrics and controls are added in the coming weeks.

## 3. Image Embedding (Experimental)

As a first step toward real-time visualization, graphs generated post-simulation are loaded and displayed within the GUI window. While still basic, this removes the need to navigate to the `data/plots/` directory manually.

---

## 4. What's Next?

- Real-time RQ and HI metric trackers during simulation steps  
- Theme support (dark/light mode toggle)  
- Option to save simulation presets for repeat testing  
- Embedding console logs in a scrollable widget inside the GUI

---

## Summary

Week 9 was all about usability and polish. By enhancing the layout, organizing outputs through tabs, and embedding visualizations, SustainHub is one step closer to becoming an interactive, self-contained research tool.

Next week, we plan to focus on real-time metric previews and further unify the visual and analytical feedback loops within the GUI.

Stay tuned!
