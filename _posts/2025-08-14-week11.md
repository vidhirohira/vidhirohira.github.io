# Week 11: Expanded Metrics and Reassignment Overhead Tracking

This week, SustainHub's focus was on **deepening analytical capabilities** by expanding the tracked metrics. We refined the computation of **Harmony Index (HI)** and **Resilience Quotient (RQ)**, and introduced a new metric — **Reassignment Overhead (RO)** — to better capture task allocation efficiency.

---

## 1. Harmony Index (HI) Refinement

The **Harmony Index** now balances two aspects more explicitly:
- **Average Success Rate**: Measures how often agents successfully complete tasks.
- **Load Balance Score**: Quantifies fairness in task distribution, reduced when workloads are uneven.

Formula:
\[
HI = 0.6 \times \text{Average Success Rate} + 0.4 \times \frac{1}{1 + \text{Load Variance}}
\]

This enhancement improves sensitivity to imbalanced task assignments, making HI a stronger indicator of collaboration quality.

## 2. Resilience Quotient (RQ) with Dynamic Recovery

The **Resilience Quotient** now integrates dynamic recovery tracking after disturbances such as dropouts:
- **Task Reallocation Efficiency (TRE)**
- **Success Rate Recovery (SRR)**
- **Harmony Stability (HS)**

Formula:
\[
RQ = 0.4 \times TRE + 0.3 \times SRR + 0.3 \times HS
\]

This approach better captures both **short-term adaptability** and **long-term stability**.

## 3. Introducing Reassignment Overhead (RO)

**RO** measures how often tasks are reassigned, highlighting inefficiencies in initial task-agent matching.

Formula:
\[
RO = \frac{\text{Reassigned Tasks}}{\text{Total Tasks Assigned}}
\]

- **Low RO** → Efficient allocation with minimal rework.  
- **High RO** → Frequent reassignments, potential skill mismatches or poor initial allocation.

By tracking RO alongside HI and RQ, SustainHub gains a **multi-angle perspective** on system performance.

---

## 4. Backend Integration

All three metrics — HI, RQ, and RO — are now:
- Computed **per simulation step**.
- Logged for **historical trend analysis**.
- Integrated into the **visualization layer** for easy interpretation.

These changes required synchronizing data structures across the agent logic, metrics computation module, and plotting functions to ensure consistency.

---

## 5. What's Next?

- Add **interactive charts** to display HI, RQ, and RO trends during simulation.
- Implement **threshold-based alerts** when metrics drop below predefined sustainability benchmarks.
- Explore **predictive modeling** to forecast metric changes based on current trends.

## Summary

Week 11 solidifies SustainHub’s analytical depth. The refined Harmony Index and Resilience Quotient, combined with the newly introduced Reassignment Overhead, provide a **comprehensive health check** for open-source community simulations. These metrics will form the backbone of upcoming visualization and alerting features, helping users not just observe but also anticipate sustainability challenges.

Stay tuned as we move towards real-time visualization of these insights in Week 12.
