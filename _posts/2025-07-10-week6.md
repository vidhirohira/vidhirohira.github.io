# Week 6: Measuring Harmony — A Metric for Sustainable Collaboration

This week, we focused on quantifying community dynamics by introducing the **Harmony Index**, a metric designed to evaluate both individual agent performance and collective fairness in task distribution. This milestone supports our broader goal: ensuring long-term stability in open-source collaboration through reinforcement learning.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Introduced Harmony Index (HI)** for real-time collaboration assessment  
- **Visualized HI trends** across simulation steps  
- **Integrated metric tracking** into the simulation pipeline  
- **Refined reward structure** for task completion and learning feedback

---

## 1. What is the Harmony Index?

The **Harmony Index (HI)** is a composite metric that captures two crucial properties:
- **Performance**: measured by the average task success rate across all agents  
- **Fairness**: measured by how evenly tasks are distributed (low variance in task loads)

This helps us answer:  
> *Is the system performing well, and are all agents contributing fairly?*

---

## 2. Why It Matters

- Prevents agent overload and burnout  
- Encourages equal participation across roles  
- Highlights coordination breakdowns early  
- Supports optimization of SARSA learning and MAB task allocation

---

## 3. How We Calculated It

We used a convex blend of success and fairness:

'HI = α * avg_success + (1 - α) * fairness_score'


- `α = 0.6` gives more weight to task performance while still rewarding balance  
- `fairness_score = 1 / (1 + variance in task load)` ensures smoother distribution improves the score  
- The index ranges between 0 and 1, with higher values representing healthier collaboration

## 4. Harmony in Action

After 10 simulation steps with 15 SARSA agents:
- **Average Harmony Index**: `0.809`  
- **Clear success/fairness balance** visible in the line chart  
- **Success rate heatmaps** showed agent-specific strengths and weaknesses  

This validated that agents not only performed well but shared responsibility effectively — a key sign of system maturity.

---

## 5. Visualization Updates

New charts were added to the analytics dashboard:
- **Harmony Index over time** (line graph)
- **Success Rate Heatmaps** (agent vs task type)
- **Role-based performance summaries**

All visualizations are saved in the `data/` directory for future analysis and benchmarking.

---

## Next Steps

- Add **Resilience Quotient (RQ)** to track system robustness under stress  
- Tune `α` dynamically based on observed variance  
- Begin **reward shaping experiments** to further influence agent learning

---

## Summary

By building and integrating the Harmony Index, we've added an interpretable and actionable signal that quantifies both performance and equity — two pillars of sustainability in open-source collaboration.

Stay tuned for next week's developments around system resilience and collaborative learning enhancements.
