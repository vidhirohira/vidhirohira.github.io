# Week 7: Stress Testing SustainHub — Resilience Quotient and System Robustness

This week, we focused on taking the next major step in our evaluation pipeline — **measuring resilience**. While last week was about maintaining harmony in ideal conditions, Week 7 was about understanding how the system behaves under **stressful, imbalanced, and uncertain environments**.

---

## Key Highlights

- Introduced **Resilience Quotient (RQ)** as a formal metric  
- Simulated **task surges and role removals** to stress-test the system  
- Visualized **system recovery and agent adaptability**  
- Logged **SARSA agent behavior** under constrained conditions

---

## 1. What is the Resilience Quotient?

The **Resilience Quotient (RQ)** measures the system’s ability to:
- **Absorb disruptions** (e.g., sudden increase in tasks or agent dropouts)
- **Recover performance** after a shock
- **Maintain fairness and task completion** under non-ideal conditions

> Think of RQ as the community’s immune system: how quickly and effectively can it bounce back?

### RQ Formula (simplified):

`RQ = (1 - ΔHI) * RecoveryRate`

Where:
- `ΔHI` = Drop in Harmony Index after disruption  
- `RecoveryRate` = Speed at which HI returns to baseline  
- RQ ∈ [0, 1], with 1 being highly resilient

---

## 2. Stress Test Scenarios

We designed two primary tests:

### A. Role-Based Agent Dropout  
- Randomly disabled a subset of agents (e.g., all Maintainers)  
- Observed reallocation behavior and backup performance from Contributors  

### B. Task Surge Injection  
- Tripled the number of incoming tasks for 3 consecutive steps  
- Measured how quickly agents adapted and balanced the load  

---

## 3. What We Observed

After 10 simulation steps (with disruptions applied in steps 4–6):
- **Harmony Index initially dropped from 0.82 → 0.64**  
- **Recovered to 0.78** by step 10  
- Calculated **Resilience Quotient: `0.743`**

### Key Insights:
- SARSA agents adapted with a brief learning lag  
- Task rebalancing via MAB was slower during role-specific dropouts  
- Fairness dipped briefly but recovered as agents diversified actions

---

## 4. Logging and Debugging Enhancements

To better monitor recovery:
- Added **RQ logs** to `simulation.py`  
- Logged **action-value updates** from Q-tables during stress  
- Plotted **HI recovery curves** across different stress levels

All relevant logs are stored under `data/logs/` and visual outputs in `data/plots/`.

---

## Next Steps

- Introduce **reward shaping** to encourage quicker recovery  
- Evaluate **long-term fatigue or agent burnout**  
- Refactor simulation for **episodic stress testing** (controlled trials)  
- Add toggle flags for stress mode in the UI/CLI

---

## Summary

Week 7 gave us critical insights into SustainHub’s **resilience and adaptability**. By simulating stress conditions and measuring RQ, we are now able to not only ensure smooth operation during normal conditions — but also ensure the system can bounce back under pressure.

Next week, we’ll explore dynamic reward tuning and meta-learning techniques to make the agents even smarter under stress.

Stay tuned!
