# Week 12: Writing the Paper and Finalizing the README

This week marked a significant milestone for SustainHub: transforming the technical work of the past weeks into **formal documentation** and **research outputs**. The focus was on two deliverables — a comprehensive **research paper** and a refined **README file** that will serve as the project's entry point for new users and contributors.

---

## 1. Research Paper Draft

The **SustainHub paper** consolidates the project’s motivation, design, and experimental results into a structured format.  

Key highlights of the paper include:
- **Introduction & Motivation**: Framing open-source sustainability challenges such as workload imbalance, contributor churn, and knowledge silos.  
- **Reinforcement Learning Approach**: Explaining the dual-layer design with Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) for task allocation and SARSA for agent-level learning.  
- **Agent Roles**: Detailing Maintainers, Contributors, Innovators, and Knowledge Curators, along with their reward structures.  
- **Metrics Framework**: Defining Harmony Index (HI), Resilience Quotient (RQ), and Reassignment Overhead (RO) as core indicators of community health.  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Documenting the Logs, Graphs, and Visualizer tabs, which make the simulation interactive and interpretable.  

The paper also positions SustainHub within broader research on **multi-agent reinforcement learning** and **OSS ecosystems**, providing both theoretical grounding and practical insights.

## 2. README File Development

Alongside the paper, a detailed **README.md** was written to make the project accessible on GitHub.  

The README now includes:
- **Project Overview**: Clear explanation of SustainHub’s purpose and goals.  
- **Objectives**: Highlighting simulation, optimization, and sustainability outcomes.  
- **Reinforcement Learning Design**: Describing MAB (global allocation) and SARSA (local learning).  
- **Agent Roles Table**: Summarizing the four agent types and their reward structures.  
- **Metrics Section**: Presenting HI, RQ, and RO with formulas and interpretations.  
- **GUI Description**: Outlining how Logs, Graphs, and Visualizer tabs function.  
- **Simulation Controls**: Explaining parameters such as tasks per step and dropouts per step.  
- **Run Instructions**: Step-by-step guide to cloning and running the project.  
- **References**: Linking SustainHub to related academic work and background literature.  

This README ensures that developers, researchers, and community members can quickly understand and engage with the project.

## 3. Impact of Documentation Work

Writing the paper and README achieved several outcomes:
- **Knowledge Consolidation**: Captured the design decisions, algorithms, and metrics in a structured form.  
- **Research Visibility**: Positioned SustainHub as a contribution to open-source sustainability and reinforcement learning literature.  
- **Community Onboarding**: Lowered barriers for new contributors by providing clear entry points.  
- **Future Extension**: Established a solid foundation for extending the simulation and integrating new features.

## 4. What’s Next?

- Begin **preparing visualizations** (graphs, screenshots, figures) to accompany the paper and README.  
- Incorporate **case studies or sample simulation runs** into the documentation.  
- Refine the GUI with more intuitive visual cues and optional NetLogo integration for advanced visualization.

## Summary

Week 12 focused on **formalizing SustainHub’s progress** into written outputs: a structured research paper and a polished README. These documents not only capture the project’s current state but also set the stage for broader dissemination, collaboration, and future development. With these foundations in place, SustainHub is moving closer to being both a **research contribution** and a **practical tool** for studying open-source sustainability.
