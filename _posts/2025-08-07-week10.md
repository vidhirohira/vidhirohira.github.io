# Week 10: Adaptive Controls and NetLogo-Based Visualization

This week, SustainHub made significant progress in simulation adaptability and visual representation. Two new interactive parameters were added to the GUI, giving users deeper control over simulation dynamics, and we initiated NetLogo-based visualizations to better understand agent behavior over time.

---

## 1. Introducing: Dropouts per Step & Tasks per Step

The GUI now includes two new sliders:

- **Dropouts per Step**  
  Allows users to define how many agents leave the system in each step, simulating contributor churn.

- **Tasks per Step**  
  Controls the number of new tasks added per simulation step, representing fluctuating workload in open-source projects.

These controls enable users to test system behavior under realistic and extreme conditions. For instance, users can simulate high task pressure with minimal agent availability or vice versa. This helps analyze how resilient the system is under such varying stress levels.

## 2. Benefits of Adaptive Simulation Parameters

These features enhance the simulation in several key ways:

- **Stress Testing Capability**  
  Explore how the system behaves under high dropout or workload scenarios.

- **Improved Realism**  
  Better mirrors real-world OSS challenges like contributor burnout or task overload.

- **Fine-Grained Control**  
  Users can model specific situations (e.g., release sprints, mass departures) for targeted insights.

- **Emergent Behavior Observation**  
  Enables discovery of interesting trends like increasing backlog, idle agent time, or failure cascades.

Together, these additions make SustainHub more suitable for use in experimentation, research, and educational settings.

## 3. NetLogo-Based Visualization (Prototype)

We began integrating NetLogo to support agent-level visualizations. Each agent (Maintainer, Contributor, Innovator, Curator) is now mapped to a turtle in the NetLogo world. Basic behaviors such as task acceptance, dropout, and movement are animated in real time.

This layer provides:

- **Visual Traceability**  
  Observe how agents interact, move, and change roles or status during simulation.

- **Behavior Verification**  
  Visually confirm logical flows such as task allocation, dropout, or reward feedback.

- **Foundation for Complex Visual Patterns**  
  Lays groundwork for implementing color-coded role transitions, network-based agent interaction, and metric overlays.

Though still in early stages, this integration adds a visual dimension to what was previously only numerical.

## 4. UI and Backend Sync

A key challenge this week was ensuring backend logic stayed consistent with the newly added parameters. Task queues now scale properly with user-defined step loads, and dropout logic cleanly removes agents while maintaining simulation continuity.

The agent pool dynamically updates, and all plots reflect the updated values in terms of task completion rates, backlog size, and agent participation.

---

## 5. What's Next?

- Enhance NetLogo visual features (labels, heat zones, dropout animations)  
- Add real-time task backlog charting in the GUI  
- UI refinement for parameter presets and save/load configurations  
- Integration of Resilience Quotient (RQ) under variable dropout conditions

---

## Summary

Week 10 marks a major step in making SustainHub simulations more customizable and visually rich. The introduction of dynamic dropout and task controls allows researchers and users to model complex, evolving scenarios, while NetLogo brings simulation events to life. As we continue to bridge backend intelligence with frontend insight, SustainHub becomes more powerful as a tool for exploring sustainability in open-source ecosystems.

Stay tuned for more enhancements next week.
